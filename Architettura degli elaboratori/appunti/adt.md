# Abstracted Data Type

An ADT is composed of **data and the operations** on that data. ADTs are useful for **information hiding**. The data types and the functions are accessible through an *interface* that the ADT provides, so that its implementation is hidden to the client. Thus if the implementation of the storage of data is changed nothing breaks, because the changed is limited by the interface.
